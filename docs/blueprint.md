# **App Name**: YT2MP3 SwiftConvert

## Core Features:

- URL Input and Validation: Accept a YouTube URL from the user, validate it client-side using JavaScript, and prepare for conversion.
- Simulated Conversion Process: Simulate the YouTube to MP3 conversion with a 3-5 second delay using JavaScript's setTimeout function to mimic backend processing.
- Download Link Generation: After the simulated conversion, dynamically generate a mock file blob or a dummy URL link to trigger the appearance of a downloadable MP3 file.
- Quality Toggle: A toggle that has no functionality but indicates to the user whether the audio quality will be 'high'

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#00FFFF) for a fun and energetic feel, capturing the speed and modernity of the converter.
- Background color: Deep, desaturated indigo (#1A237E) to provide a stark contrast, making the electric blue elements pop and enhancing the user's focus.
- Accent color: Neon Green (#39FF14) for highlights and call-to-action buttons, drawing attention and creating visual interest.
- Font: 'Poppins', a clean, modern, and friendly sans-serif font for readability and a contemporary feel.
- Use modern and consistent icons, possibly inline SVGs for steps and features, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- The main input area will be a visually dominant 'card' with rounded corners and a slight shadow/glow, emphasizing its importance. Occupies 90% of the mobile screen width.
- Subtle CSS transitions (e.g., fade-ins for sections, smooth color changes) to provide a modern feel without being intrusive or affecting performance on older devices.
